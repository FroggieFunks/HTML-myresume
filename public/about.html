<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Adam Perea and here is a little bit about who I am. I grew up in Denver, CO, raised by my wonderful mother and father that are responsible for the man I am today. I graduated highschool and immediately started working at a print shop with my father.I wanted to make a carreer out of it, but the printing industry was on a decline do to the fast expansion of the internet. The printing industry was becoming a thing of the past. I then moved over to being a mechanic, which I've been my entire life due to my dad teaching me at an early age. I've been a mechanic since then, and I'm a good mechanic. Now I'm looking to make a change. That brings me to where I'm at now which is trying to get into the coding industry. I love writing code, it brings me joy when i load that page and my website pops up on the internet. I am on a journey to learn as much as I can about coding and cyber security. That pretty much sums up my professional history.</p>
